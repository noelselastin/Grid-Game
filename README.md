This is a reinforcement learning program to calculate the shortest path from one square to another, without falling on the "hole" squares, on a 5x5 grid. 
Run gridgame.ipynb and enjoy!!
You can change board1 variable and try out different board setups, but you should also change best_action_values variable and set the best path of the setup 
manually, inorder to get the accuracy.
